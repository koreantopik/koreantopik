 👋 Hi, I’m [@koreantopik](https://github.com/koreantopik)
 
- 👀 I’m interested in Korean language learning, cultural integration, and web development.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced GitHub workflows and contributing to open-source projects.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on language learning resources and educational tools.
  
- 📫 How to reach me: Visit my self-study Korean website [KoreanTopik](https://www.koreantopik.com) or connect with me here on GitHub.
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve been helping foreigners adapt to Korean society for over 12 years through my blog and community projects!
